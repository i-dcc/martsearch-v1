### httpd.conf ###

You will need to add a line to your httpd.conf for each different mart server that is called by your app (to get around cross-site scripting limits) - this relies on you using apache with mod_proxy or something equivalent...

i.e.

ProxyPass /htgt/ http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/
ProxyPass /biomart/ http://www.biomart.org/
