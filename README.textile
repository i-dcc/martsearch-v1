h1. Easymart

Welcome to easymart! Easymart is a configurable web services based search interface for "Biomart":http://www.biomart.org/. It is
being developed primarily for (intended) use with the "i-DCC project":http://i-dcc.org (International Data Coordination Centre), a (soon to be
coming) central portal for mouse mutation information.

The interface is 100% javascript and uses the "jQuery":http://jquery.com library.

h2. Apache httpd.conf

You will need to add a couple of lines to your httpd.conf for each different mart server that is called by your app (to get
around cross-site scripting limits) - this relies on you using apache with mod_proxy or something equivalent...

i.e. Here's our internal apache conf:

<pre>
  <code>
    ProxyRequests Off

    <Proxy *>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass /htgt http://gtrap1a.internal.sanger.ac.uk:9001/htgt
    ProxyPassReverse /htgt http://gtrap1a.internal.sanger.ac.uk:9001/htgt

    ProxyPass /biomart http://www.biomart.org
    ProxyPassReverse /biomart http://www.biomart.org
    ProxyRemote http://www.biomart.org http://wwwcache.sanger.ac.uk:3128
  </code>
</pre>
