h1. Easymart Readme

Welcome to easymart!  Easymart is a configurable web services based search interface for "Biomart":http://www.biomart.org/.  It is being developed primarily for (intended) use with the i-DCC project (International Data Coordination Centre), a (soon to be coming) central portal for mouse mutation information.

The interface is 100% javascript and uses the "jQuery":http://jquery.com library.

h2. Apache httpd.conf

You will need to add a line to your httpd.conf for each different mart server that is called by your app (to get around cross-site scripting limits) - this relies on you using apache with mod_proxy or something equivalent...

i.e.

ProxyPass /htgt/ http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/
ProxyPass /biomart/ http://www.biomart.org/
